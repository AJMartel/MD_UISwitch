This is a small library to uniformly encapsulate the use of different types of switches as user input devices.

Switch types handled are:

The library includes the following features:
* Detects press, double press, long press and auto repeat.
* Works with either either low/high or high/low transitions.
* Software debounce of initial keypress, configurable time period.
* Software double press detection, configurable time period.
* Software long press detection, configurable time period.
